# Sample Assignment (from a studio art course)

## Course Context

Most students are sophomore- or junior- level art students who have taken
basic drawing and form classes in their first year, and are moving on
to more focused courses.  This assignment is given in a course on drawing
anatomically realistic figures.
## Assignment

Draw a self-portrait on paper with pencil

## Educational Goals

Practice conveying emotion in drawing, practice
correct rendering of human facial anatomy

## Intermediate Stages

2-3 preliminary sketches illustrating different
possible emotions in your portrait.

## Completion

Preliminary sketches should be brought to class the week
before the assignment is due

## Peer-review

Students will be broken into small groups.  Each group
will hang all of its sketches on the wall and discuss them
collectively.  Students will be asked to discuss which emotions each
sketch conveys and which are being conveyed effectively.  Students
will be asked to identify strong and weak representations of anatomy
across the group's set of sketches.

## Grading

Students will submit their sketches and the final portrait
for grading.  Grades will weigh the final portrait at 80%, and
improvements from the sketches to the portrait at 20%.

## Thoughts

This seems a bit passive.  It would be great to find a way
to have students critique each other's processes for coming up with
portrait ideas.
